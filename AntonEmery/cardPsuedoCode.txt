rank is Ace, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen, King  13 total
suits are in order of Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs
number each card in order from 0-51	

0 = ace of hearts
1 = ace of diamonds
2 = ace of spades
3 = aces of clubs
4 = two of hearts
5 = two of diamonds
6 = two of spaces
7 = two of clubs

rank is suit changes every four indexes. 

i /*input into function*/ = (4 x R /*suit[i]*/) + C /*rank[i]*/

R = math.floor(id / 4)



var rank = ['Ace', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four', 'Five', 'Six', 
			  'Seven', 'Eight', 'Nine', 'Ten', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King' ];

var suit = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Spades', 'Clubs'];


function rank(id) {
	rank[i] = math.floor(id / 4);
	return rank[i];
	}

Suite = interger % 4;

Hearts and Diamonds are red   Spades and Clubs are black.

to get color we need to take the value of the card suit function 
if suit >= 0 && suit <= 1 color is red
	
else if suit >= 2 && suit <= 3 color = black

name function
	given i find rank and suit
	return rank and suit

to find card id given rank and suit
ID = (13 x rank) + suit  //13 is number of rows

function cardID(a) {    //rank, suit
	 	
	
}

function rank(id) {  //return 1-13
	var rankNumber = Math.ceil((id + 1) / 4); //rank number is one more than array index since arrays start at 0 but ranks starts at 1
	return rankNumber;
	}
