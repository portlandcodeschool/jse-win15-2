suits are in order of Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs
number each card in order from 0-51	

0 = ace of hearts
1 = ace of diamonds
2 = ace of spades
3 = aces of clubs
4 = two of hearts
5 = two of diamonds
6 = two of spaces
7 = two of clubs

rank is suit changes every four indexes. 

i /*input into function*/ = (4 x R /*suit[i]*/) + C /*rank[i]*/

R = math.floor(id / 4)



var rank = ['Ace', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four', 'Five', 'Six', 
			  'Seven', 'Eight', 'Nine', 'Ten', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King' ];

var suit = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Spades', 'Clubs'];


function rank(id) {
	rank[i] = math.floor(id / 4);
	return rank[i];
	}

Suite = interger % 4;

Hearts and Diamonds are red   Spades and Clubs are black.

to get color we need to take the value of the card suit function 
if suit >= 0 && suit <= 1 color is red
	
else if suit >= 2 && suit <= 3 color = black
